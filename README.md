### Hi, my name is Michał 👋
I'm a passionate Java programmer, constantly looking for new challenges. I'm always happy to learn new technologies and develop myself as a coder.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my project ActualApp. Application is almost ready, all main functions are implemented, but I'm still improving it to be 100% satisfied with the result!
- 🌱 Two main technologies that I learn right now are Spring and React
- 💬 Ask me about my projects or anything you want to know ☺️
