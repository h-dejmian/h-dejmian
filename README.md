### Hi, my name is MichaÅ‚ ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate Java programmer, always looking for new challenges. I'm always happy to learn new technologies and develop myself as a coder.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my project ActualApp. Application is almost ready, all main functions are implemented, but I'm still improving it to be 100% satisfied with the result!
- ðŸŒ± Right now I'm learning Spring and React
